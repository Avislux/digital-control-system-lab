# Digital Control Systems Lab assignement (ECE414L at Cal Poly Pomona)

Digital Control Systems lab project for building a fuzzy logic controller on a Spartan 3E FPGA.

I decided to put some old code from college up for posterity. This code was used to program the FPGA. We also needed to connect various electrical components. One such circuit was a difference amplifier from an OP AMP.

The goal of the project was to use a fuzzy logic controller to control the speed of a fan with varying inputs from a light and temperature source.
